## Problem Statement

Construction sites are energy intensive environments, often relying heavily on
diesel generators and grid electricity. This results in high carbon emissions
and elevated operating costs. Our group has personally observed frequent fuel
deliveries at active sites, long generator run times during non peak hours and
High maintenance cost, along side the lack of research in this specific topic.

## Research Question

How would the use of renewable energy affect construction sites in terms of cost
, Energy usage and carbon emissions within the middle east and african regions

## [Domain Study](./0_domain_study/README.md)

* Construction sites today depend heavily on diesel generators (30–1000 kW) and
 occasional grid hookups, driving up costs and emissions.
* Integrating solar PV, wind turbines and batteries in hybrid systems can cut
 fuel usage by 10–25%, but real world pilots and detailed equipment level data
 remain scarce.
* Key barriers include fuel delivery delays, under loaded genset inefficiency
 and wildly varying regional policies (UAE Vision 2050 vs. off-grid African initiatives).
* Policy design, IoT/AI based scheduling and targeted case studies are the
 drivers for making renewable integration both practical and cost effective.

## System Thinking

**Event:** the power outage on the construction site.

**Pattern/trends:** the consistent need to maintain power generators.

**Structure:** Idle Inefficiency of power generators at <30% load are 20% less efficient
and increase the need for maintenance.

**Mental Model:** The common idea that power generators are the best source for power.
