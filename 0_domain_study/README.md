## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background on Energy Usage in Construction

Construction sites consume vast amounts of energy for machinery, lighting, and
temporary facilities. Diesel generators account for most off grid power needs,
with grid connections used where available.

### 1.2 The Growing Need for Energy Optimization

Rising fuel prices and stringent emissions targets are driving the industry
toward more efficient energy use.

### 1.3 Research Focus

This review focuses on integrating renewable sources solar PV, wind turbines,
and battery storage to optimize the energy mix and scheduling on construction sites.

### 1.4 Regional Scope

We compare practices and policies in the United Arab Emirates and selected
African nations to reflect differences in grid reliability and regulatory frameworks.

## 2. Overview of Energy Use on Construction Sites

### 2.1 Typical Energy Demands by Construction Phase

* **Mobilization:** Site offices, lighting, hoisting equipment (20–50 kW).
* **preliminary:** Lighting, Air condition, Water Pumps (5-20kw)
* **Construction Work:** light equipments power tools (10–20 kW).

### 2.2 Common Equipment and Power Ratings

| Equipment             | Power Rating (kW) |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| HVAC Equipments       | 5–20              |
| Water pumps           | 3–10            |
| Site lighting cluster | 5–20              |
| light equipments power tools | 3–10              |
| Water Heaters | 5–10              |
| Site offices | 5–15              |

### 2.3 Project Scale Comparison

* **Small (<1 MW):** Portable gensets, minimal PV.
* **Medium (1–5 MW):** Hybrid gensets + battery pilots.
* **Large (>5 MW):** Microgrid designs integrating PV and wind.

## 3. Types of Energy Sources

### 3.1 Conventional: Diesel and Grid

Diesel generators deliver reliable power but at higher cost and emissions
grid electricity is cheaper but may be intermittent in remote areas.

### 3.2 Renewable Options

* **Solar PV:** Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) relatively low.
* **Wind Turbines:** Effective in coastal or elevated sites;.
* **Battery Storage:**  enables peak shaving and load shifting.

### 3.3 Regional Trends

* **UAE:** Strong solar incentives, net meter policies, 2 GW seasonal storage targets.

* **Africa:** Off grid solar programs in Kenya, Nigeria microfinancing for
 hybrid systems. [Source](https://www.arei.info/eng)

## 4. Challenges in Conventional Energy Usage

* **Fuel Logistics:** Delivery Time increase downtime.
* **Grid Reliability**
* **Emissions:** Gensets emit 0.7 kg CO₂/kWh [Emission Calculator](https://www.cencepower.com/calculators/kwh-to-co2-calculator).
* **Idle Inefficiency:** Gensets at <30% load are 20% less efficient [Source](https://www.cat.com/en_US/by-industry/electric-power/Articles/White-papers/the-impact-of-generator-set-underloading.html).
