# Milestone 1: Problem Identification

## **What We will Stop Doing**

We spent way too much time casting a wide net through countless reports and
articles only to realize half of it didn’t really apply to our project. From now
on, we will pick sources that directly inform our core question instead of trying
to read everything in sight. We will also avoid shoe horning UAE and African
policies into one section; keeping them separate will save us a lot of
backtracking later.

## **What We will Keep Doing**

We loved how clearly we cited reputable reports and kept our sections organized
(e.g. Challenges versus Opportunities). That made our draft feel solid and
trustworthy so let’s stick with that structure. Our links to official road shows
and policy announcements were especially powerful, so we will keep hunting down
those high value references.

## **What We will Start Doing**

Next time, we want to get our hands on real numbers. Rather than talking in
broad percentages, let’s reach out to a site manager or equipment provider for
actual data on how many hours a generator really runs or what a solar diesel
pilot achieved. We will also zoom in on one or two hybrid micro-grid case studies
so we don’t spread ourselves too thin.

## **Key Lessons Learned**

* Defining our regional focus early (UAE versus specific African markets) makes
 comparisons feel meaningful, not confusing.
* Sketching out those feedback loops helped us see how downtime and fuel
 deliveries really feed into each other now we know exactly which data points
 to track.
* Policies and incentives can be wildly different from one country to the next
 a one size fits all summary just doesn’t cut it.
* Finally, there’s a real data gap at the equipment level if we don’t collect or
 simulate those per-machine energy profiles, our optimization work will stay theoretical.
