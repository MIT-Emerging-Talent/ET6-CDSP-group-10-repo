# Key Factors to Consider When Selecting a Research Question

## 1. Relevance & Impact

• Does the problem matter to your target audience (students, engineers, policymakers)?

• Will solving it improve lives, policies, processes, or outcomes?

• Is it aligned with global, local, or academic priorities (e.g. SDGs,

engineering education, infrastructure resilience)?

## 2. Feasibility

• Is it realistic to complete within your timeline, resources, and skill set?

• Is the required data openly available and accessible remotely?

• Are the tools and skills needed for analysis within your team's capacity (or learnable)?

## 3. Originality & Innovation

• Is the question unique or a fresh take on an existing problem?

• Can you offer a new perspective, data source, or method others haven’t
explored much?

## 4. Specificity & Clarity

• Is the question clear, focused, and well-defined?

• Avoid vague or overly broad questions like *"How can we solve world hunger?"
“How can we bring everlasting peace to the world?”*

• Aim for something precise like **"Can machine learning models predict student
 GPA based on attendance and study habits?"**

## 5. Ethical & Social Considerations

• Would working on this question raise ethical concerns? (e.g. privacy, fairness)

• Can your results be misused, or would it marginalize vulnerable groups?

• Is consent needed for certain data types (especially with personal student records)?

## 6. Data Availability

• Is the data you need open-source, free, or easily accessible?

• Can you easily collect data without challenges?

• Will your team need resources, tools, and equipment to collect data?

• Are the above-mentioned resources available for data collection?

• Is it clean, well-structured, and in a format you can work with (CSV, JSON, API)?

• Will you need to collect primary data? (this is tougher for remote teams)

## 7. Interdisciplinary Potential

• Does the problem benefit from diverse backgrounds and skill sets in your team?

• Can civil, electrical, mechanical, wood, software and other engineering
 discipline all contribute meaningfully?

## 8 Scalability & Future Research

• Can your research question lead to follow-up studies, improvements,
or spin-off projects?

• Could your model or framework be adapted for other contexts or datasets?

## Rule of thumb

**A good research question is:**

Relevant, specific, achievable, data-supported, ethically sound, and worth answering.
