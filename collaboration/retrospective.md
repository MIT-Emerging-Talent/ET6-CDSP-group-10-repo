# Retrospective: MILESTONE 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

## Stop Doing

- Waiting too long to schedule team meetings.
- Assuming everyone has the same understanding without confirming.
- Leaving documentation to the last minute.

## Continue Doing

- Leveraging each memberâ€™s domain expertise.
- Respecting time constraints and being flexible with schedules.
- Using GitHub to keep track of planning documents.

## Start Doing

- Create a shared calendar with key deadlines and meetings.
- Regularly check in on individual progress.
- Begin drafting reports during the milestone, not just at the end.

## Lessons Learned

- Cross functional teams bring unique insights, but require extra effort in coordination.
- Clearly defining the research question early avoids scope creep.
- Time management is as important as technical work.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Name: DATA NERDS

We collaborated well despite different backgrounds. Challenges included aligning
expectations and timelines, but overall progress was steady. Each member brought
a unique lens to the problem, enhancing our understanding. We look forward to a
more data-focused Milestone 2.
